This week I've been setting up a lab for Windows Active Directory. This will be handy for all kinds of testing and learning. With the extreme ubiquity of Windows it's definitely worth my time and I know I'll come back to this lab frequently in the future.

First I've grabbed the Windows Enterprise Evaluation images available for free from Microsoft. [Microsoft Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022) , [Microsoft WIndows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) . I've gone ahead and installed both on Virtualbox. For the moment I'm just setting up one user machine and one server, I can always add more as needed later.

Next I boot up the server and start install Active Directory Domain Services. This is a simple setup and I don't need any of the less commonly used options at the moment.

I get ahead of myself here and don't install DNS with the AD services installation wizard and have to install it separately. A DNS server is needed for AD clients to communicate with the server. In this case I will run it on the same server, that makes it easy.

Once the DNS server is installed I configure the Active Directory domain controller.

I add a single forest and name the domain adtest.local

By default Virtualbox does not allow intra-VM communications, this is good for security but I will need these VMs to communicate. I add a second adapter to the server and attach it to the virtual internal network. I do the same for the user PC.

The windows server will need a static IP on this adapter as it will be the DNS server. I've also added it as it's own DNS server in the manual configuration, allowing it to be configured. A little funny but the server won't be able to communicate with it's own DNS server for configuration otherwise.

For the user PC I do the same, setting the server as it's DNS and also giving it a static IP. For the moment I don't have DHCP setup and manual configuration isn't a burden for such a small number of machines.

I should now be able to join the domain from the user PC, I give it a test and am happy to see it's all working perfectly.

I confirm on the server side that the computer has been added to the domain.

Next I add a test user from the admin console. I make this user part of the default domain users group, I'll add more users and groups later for more testing.

Checking the account from the user PC I am able to log in and it all looks good.

Next I want to make a simple group policy, I choose to apply it to the entire domain. I will enforce a specific wallpaper and see if it functions.

I select the administrative templates an find the template for desktop wallpapers.

I'm just going one of the wallpapers from the windows defaults for this test. I find the path for one of the wallpapers that comes with windows but isn't the blue one that is set by default and enter into the wallpaper policy.

With that policy applied I log in again on the user PC and find the wallpaper has changed. The policy has been properly applied.

Setup was smooth and I'm happy with the results. I now have a perfect setup for future projects. Next up I'll probably look at some more complex user/group configuration, group policies, network storage or DHCP.
